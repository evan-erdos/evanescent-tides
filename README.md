# Pitch
A puzzle game where you control the moon, and thus the tide level, which you must utilize to solve puzzles. The magical realism spirit of The Little Prince.

# Style
The game will be played on a fairly small hexogonal grid. The hexagons/tiles are for visual style and for water physics calculations, and can/will be on the small side of things. ie: each "position" that the boat can be at (or the size of land bridges and other such things) can take up a multide of hexagons in the world.

THe color pallete is very pastel, fairly flat, but still with material shaders - shadows, and so on.
 
# Story

### Prelude
A small girl, luna, is stranged on an old island, by an abandonded scientific research facility. She discovers, through the telescope, that watching the moon's position seems to be quite helpful. She can move the moon around, manipulate the tides, and bring a landlocked ship to her, so she can finally leave her lonely research facility and go home.

# Gameplay
As the boat becomes closer, the islands, rocks, and floatsam become more dense - and the puzzles more complicated.

## Mechanics
- Reveal or hide a land bridge
- Move a barge
- Icebergs that melt
- Push/Pull objects
- Get a boat stuck so you can move other things
